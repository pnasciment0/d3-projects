# d3 projects

A collection of d3 visualization projects done for CS 239. To see the visualizations, start an HTTP server at your desired local port (for example, python -m http.server:8000) in the relevant directory. For directories with more than one HTML file, visit localhost:8000/foo.html, where foo is the HTML file you wish to see.
